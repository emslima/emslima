<h3>Olá, hello, ciao, bonjour, harō, privet, nǐ hǎo... World!</h3>

my name is Emerson Lima, I'm a <strong>self-taught developer</strong>  and  <strong>university student </strong>. I've been studying frontend since 2021 and recently I've been deepening into <strong>Frontend</strong>. Since the beginning I try to create responsive and nice designs, clean code, and always prioritizing the user experience, no matter what browser or operating system you are on.

This is my adventure, and I surf it with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript.</strong><br><br>
