Hello World,

my name is Emerson Lima, I'm a self-taught developer, and I currentlylive in Vitória, Espírito Santo. I've been studying frontend since 2022 and recently I've been deepening into Web Dev. Since the beginning I try to create responsive and nice designs, clean code, and always prioritizing the user experience, no matter what browser or operating system you are on.

This is my adventure, and I surf it with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
