<h3>Ol치, hello, ciao, bonjour, har콄, privet, n킗 h킕o... World!</h3>

my name is Emerson Lima, I'm a <strong>self-taught developer</strong>  and  <strong>university student </strong>, and I currently live in Vit칩ria, Esp칤rito Santo. I've been studying frontend since 2022 and recently I've been deepening into <strong>Web Dev</strong> and <strong>Frontend</strong>. Since the beginning I try to create responsive and nice designs, clean code, and always prioritizing the user experience, no matter what browser or operating system you are on.
